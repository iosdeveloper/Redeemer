Redeemer is meant to give you the idea of a voucher redemption system for your iOS app like App Store Promo Codes. Redeemer is especially made for a newspaper or magazine app but can be easily changed to suit any existing environment.

Setting up Redeemer

 - Create a new MySQL table by either uploading "codes.sql" or by copying the contents of the file.
 - By using a service like random.org create 12-character long strings.
 - Create new table records containing the random strings (your codes) and a 6-character long issue id like "3-2011" (in the sample project "-" is replaced with "/").
 - Change credentials in "redeem.php" and upload the file to your server.
 - Change URL to "redeem.php" in "Redeemer.m".
 - "Build and Run".
